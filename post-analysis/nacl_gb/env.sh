################################ GROMACS #######################################


# First we'll set an environment variable for the main GROMACS binary. This is
# good practice for running WESTPA simulations on clusters, as repeatedly
# calling "gmx" rather than the absolute path to gmx (e.g.,
# "/usr/local/gromacs/bin/gmx") can take a long time and be harder on the
# filesystem.  For this tutorial, this step is not necessary but nonetheless
# demonstrates good practice.

# Here, we check if the gmx executable is available. If gmx is available, the
# exit code of "which gmx" is zero, and we execute the code inside the 
# if-statement. If gmx is not available, "which gmx" returns a non-zero exit  
# code representing an error; we then instead execute the code between "else" 
# and "fi". The string "&>/dev/null" makes sure that any output from the command
# "which gmx" is not printed to the terminal.
if which gmx &>/dev/null ; then
  # Note the 'export' command.  This makes sure that the environment variable
  # "GMX" is available to other scripts that run "source env.sh".
  export GMX=$(which gmx) #the "which" command gives us the absolute path to gmx
else
  echo "Could not find your GROMACS installation.  Please check your path and "
  echo "make sure that gmx executable is available."
  exit 1
fi

############################## Python and WESTPA ###############################
# Next inform WESTPA what python it should use.  
export WEST_PYTHON=$(which python2.7)

# Check to make sure that the environment variable WEST_ROOT is set. 
# Here, the code '[ -z "$WEST_ROOT"]' will return TRUE if WEST_ROOT is not set,
# causing us to enter the if-statement, print an error message, and exit.
if [ -z "$WEST_ROOT" ]; then
  echo "The environment variable WEST_ROOT is not set."
  echo "Try running 'source westpa.sh' from the WESTPA installation directory"
  exit 1
fi

# Explicitly name our simulation root directory.  Similar to the statement 
# above, we check if the variable is not set.  If the variable is not set,
# the we set it 
if [ -z "$WEST_SIM_ROOT" ]; then
  export WEST_SIM_ROOT="$PWD"
fi

# Set the simulation name.  Whereas "WEST_SIM_ROOT" gives us the entire 
# absolute path to the simulation directory, running the "basename" command
# will give us only the last part of that path (the directory name).
export SIM_NAME=$(basename $WEST_SIM_ROOT)
